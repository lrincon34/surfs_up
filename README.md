## Key Difference between June and December
After running the statistics for June and December, the counts came very close to each other. In 2015 was the only year where December had only 158 counts vs. June of the same year had 188. The mean average for June 2013- 2016 came in around .1513 and the mean for December 2013- 2016 came in around .1783, therefore December had a higher average precipiation than June. As far as the standard deviation, June's came in at around .3112 and December came in higher again at about .38 and the max for June was about 2.105 vs. December was about 2.75. Although I ran statistics for years 2010 thru 2017, I focused on the most recent years, 2013 thru 2016 to arrive at the averages for each statistic.

### Recommendation #1
One recommendation I would have is to possibly look at additional months in order to determine more about the precipitation for the entire year. I think only looking at 2 out of the 12 months is not enought to support a good valuation.

### Recommendation #2
Another recommendation I would have would be to only look at the mean, standard deviation and max statistics. I think that having too mamy sets of points or stats can make the analysis a bit complicated, specially if many of them are similar. You would want to focus on the stats where the bigger differences are and then gather information as to why do would occur.
